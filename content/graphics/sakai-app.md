Problem: UNC and some other schools use a platform called Sakai as its educational software that connects the community that uses it. Within Sakai, professors can upload grades, post assignments, etc. Students on the otherhand, can upload assignments, check grades, etc.

However, Sakai has a lot of usability issues. As a junior now, I remember how difficult it was to be accustomed to Sakai as a freshman. It took a long time to learn. Furthermore, it wasn't easily assessible on mobile devices. Sakai has poor scalability and to get from just point A to point B within the site took more effort than necessary. 

Here's a look at Sakai on my phone.

Therefore my goals were to: </br>
1. Create a mobile application </br>
2. Allow for better usability </br>
3. Provide easier navigation </br>
4. Provide everything that is available on the website </br>

Design Principles </br>
1. Simplicity</br>
2. Speed </br>
3. Robust

Interviews 

I set out to ask people, students, professors. </br>
1. What do you like about Sakai?</br>
2. What do you not like about Sakai?</br>
3. What issues did you find when using Sakai?</br>
4. What is your biggest pet peeve with the app?</br>
5. What functionality would you like to see be added?

Research </br>
I set out to look at some other apps that were being used by other schools. For example, Blackboard.

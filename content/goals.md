There's much uncertainty in regards for my future but I know it involves helping a third world country. Whether it's a medical mission, integrating technology or even photographing the reality and beauty of another culture, I know that my life will not be limited to one spot.

One year from now...

I WILL be ready to graduate.<br/>
I WILL have taken the MCAT.<br/>
I WILL have an internship lined up in tech.<br/>
I WILL be planning to travel abroad in aid of third world countries.

Five years from now...

I WILL be in medical school or working full-time at a tech company.

Long-term goals...

Manage a successful photography business.<br/>
Retire and become a paid travel photographer.<br/>
Become an entrepenuer <br/>
Open my own private practice.<br/>
Create an popular app.

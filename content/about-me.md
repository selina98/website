Artist. Athlete. Adventurer.

I'm a native Ohioan turned lifelong Tar Heel. 

I grew up doing gymnastics and was a gymnast for The University of North Carolina before my body gave up on me. A student-athlete turned student, I'm now pursuing my passion for photography, medicine, computer science, and...jump rope. Random I know.

But I know you came here for more than that so here are some facts about me.

College: The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill <br/>
Year: Junior <br/>
Major: Computer Science<br/>
Minor: Chemistry
